#Assignment A3: Geo-specific Python Library Exploration!
This folder contains the work for Assignment 3 (A3), where I explored using the folium  to create interactive maps with driving directions between two cities in Pakistan: Lahore and Karachi.

  Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of Folium and OpenRouteService API to create the interactive driving directions map.

- **environment.yml**  
  Conda environment file containing all dependencies required to run the notebook.

- **requirements.txt**
